# das-grafana

## User Management

User management is handled by a combination of Auth0 and GitHub, this integration prevents login using the admin account from a browser.  After deploying a new instance of das-grafana you will need to add users to the admin roles by making API calls using the admin account.  The admin credentials are stored in a Kubernetes secret.  Execute the following PowerShell to add a user to an admin role.  First login with your user via the Auth0 GitHub flow then execute the following PowerShell to make your user an admin:

```
$Base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(("{0}:{1}" -f $Username,$Password)))
$Headers = @{Authorization=("Basic {0}" -f $Base64AuthInfo); "Content-Type" = "application/json"}
$GrafanaBaseUri = "https://<env>-tools.apprenticeships.education.gov.uk/grafana"
## test authentication works
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $GrafanaBaseUri/api/orgs -Method GET -Headers $Headers
$Body = @{"loginOrEmail"="user@example.com";"role"="Admin"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $GrafanaBaseUri/api/orgs/<orgid>/users -Method POST -Headers $Headers -Body $($Body | ConvertTo-Json -Compress) -UserAgent $([Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.PSUserAgent]::Chrome.ToString()) -Verbose
```

Once your user is an admin you'll be able to complete the remaining config, including adding other users as admin, via the Grafana GUI.  Additional documentation on user management can be found [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/http_api/org/#admin-organizations-api).
